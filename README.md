PMDA – Plex Music Dedupe Assistant
==================================

You know that special moment when you search for an album in Plex... and find FIVE versions of it? Same title. Different folders. Possibly different formats. Mostly just chaos.

After waiting patiently for Plex to address this (spoiler: they didn’t), I gave up and built PMDA — a tool that automatically finds and deduplicates those pesky duplicate albums in your Plex Music library.

Whether you're a FLAC connoisseur or just tired of MP3 clutter, PMDA has your back.

🌟 What PMDA Does
-----------------

- Scans your entire Plex Music library
- Detects duplicate albums based on:
  - Normalized album titles
  - Identical or overlapping track listings
  - Matching track titles (85%+ similarity)
  - Audio format, bitrate, and sample rate
- Picks the best-quality version (FLAC wins!)
- Moves duplicates to a `Plex_dupes/` folder
- Cleans metadata from Plex via API
- Offers a fast Web UI to review and dedupe

🧠 Now with AI!
---------------

PMDA now (optionally) uses the openai API to explain differences between album versions. This feature costs a few cents to run and can be customized with your own `ai_prompt.txt` to fit your style.

💻 Web UI Features
------------------

- Visual grid of duplicates with cover art
- Album format and version info
- Deduplicate one-by-one or all at once
- Shows potential space savings
- Reversible merge logic

⚙️ Configuration (config.json)
------------------------------

Here is a sample `config.json` to adjust:

```json
{
  "PLEX_DB_FILE": "/database/com.plexapp.plugins.library.db",
  "PLEX_HOST": "http://192.168.3.2:32401",
  "PLEX_TOKEN": "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE",
  "SECTION_ID": 1,
  "PATH_MAP": {
    "/music/matched": "/music/matched"
  },
  "DUPE_ROOT": "/dupes",
  "WEBUI_PORT": 5005,
  "STATE_DB_FILE": "/app/pmda_state.db",
  "CACHE_DB_FILE": "/app/pmda_cache.db"
}
```

Optional:
- `ai_prompt.txt`: Customize how the AI handles and explains duplicates.

🚀 Run PMDA in Docker
---------------------

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name pmda \
  -p 5005:5005 \
  -v /path/to/config/config.json:/app/config.json:ro \
  -v /path/to/config/ai_prompt.txt:/app/ai_prompt.txt:ro \
  -v "/path/to/plex/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-in Support/Databases":/database:ro \
  -v /path/to/music:/music \
  -v /path/to/dupes:/dupes \
  silkyclouds/pmda:latest
```

It runs in verbose mode by default.

🧪 Run Without Docker (Bare Metal or Virtualenv)
------------------------------------------------

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/silkyclouds/PMDA.git
cd PMDA
```

2. Create a virtualenv and install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo apt install ffmpeg  # for ffprobe
```

3. Adjust `config.json` as shown above.

4. Run the Web UI:

```bash
python3 pmda.py --serve --verbose
```

5. Or run CLI mode:

```bash
python3 pmda.py --dry-run
```

🛠 CLI Options
--------------

- `--dry-run`: Simulate actions
- `--safe-mode`: Skip Plex API deletions
- `--tag-extra`: Keep non-standard album metadata
- `--verbose`: Show detailed logging
- `--serve`: Run Web UI
