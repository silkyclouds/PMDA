PMDA – Plex Music Dedupe Assistant
==================================

You know that special moment when you search for an album in Plex... and find FIVE versions of it? Same title. Different folders. Possibly different formats. Mostly just chaos.

After waiting patiently for Plex to address this (spoiler: they didn’t), I gave up and built PMDA — a tool that automatically finds and deduplicates those pesky duplicate albums in your Plex Music library.

Whether you're a FLAC connoisseur or just tired of MP3 clutter, PMDA has your back.

## 🌟 What PMDA Does

PMDA (Plex Music Dedupe Assistant) helps you identify and clean up duplicate albums in your Plex music library, with smart logic and a user-friendly interface.

Here's what it currently does:

- 🔍 **Scans your entire Plex Music library**  
  Connects directly to your Plex database for deep access to metadata and file structure.

- 🎯 **Detects duplicate albums using advanced logic**  
  - Normalized album titles
  - Identical or overlapping track listings
  - 85%+ track title similarity
  - Audio format, bitrate, sample rate, and bit depth
  - Prefers FLAC over MP3 and higher quality over lossy

- 🏆 **Automatically picks the best-quality version**  
  Keeps the best copy, moves the rest to a `Plex_dupes/` folder.

- 🧹 **Cleans metadata via the Plex API**  
  Optionally removes leftover metadata references to moved albums (unless in safe mode).

- 🖥️ **Provides a modern Web UI**  
  - Grid view of all duplicate groups with covers and metadata
  - Stats: total albums, artists, dupes, space saved
  - Real-time scanning feedback with dynamic updates
  - Options to deduplicate per album, per selection, or globally

- 🧪 **Supports dry-run and safe-mode**  
  - `--dry-run`: preview actions without changing anything
  - `--safe-mode`: move files but skip Plex API cleanup

- 📊 **Tracks stats over time**  
  - Total space reclaimed
  - Number of deduplicated albums
  - Persistent tracking in local databases

- 🔧 **Fully configurable via `config.json`**  
  Set everything from the Web UI port to Plex paths, token, section ID, and more.

- 🤖 **Optional OpenAI integration**  
  Uses `gpt-4o` or another model to help score duplicates (almost zero cost with GPT-4o-Nano).

- 🧠 **Works entirely offline (if OpenAI is disabled)**  
  No dependency on cloud services unless you choose to use the LLM helper.



🧠 Now with AI!
---------------

PMDA now (optionally) uses the openai API to detect and explain differences between album versions. This feature costs a few cents to run and can be customized with your own `ai_prompt.txt` to fit your style.

- Visual grid of duplicates with cover art
- Album format and version info
- Deduplicate one-by-one or all at once
- Shows potential space savings
- Reversible merge logic

⚙️ Configuration (config.json)
------------------------------

Here is a sample `config.json` to adjust:

```json
{
  "PLEX_DB_FILE": "/database/com.plexapp.plugins.library.db",
  "PLEX_HOST": "http://192.168.3.2:32401",
  "PLEX_TOKEN": "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE",
  "SECTION_ID": 1,
  "PATH_MAP": {
    "/music/matched": "/music/matched"
  },
  "DUPE_ROOT": "/dupes",
  "WEBUI_PORT": 5005,
  "STATE_DB_FILE": "/app/pmda_state.db",
  "CACHE_DB_FILE": "/app/pmda_cache.db"
}
```

Optional:
- `ai_prompt.txt`: Customize how the AI handles and explains duplicates.

🚀 Run PMDA in Docker
---------------------

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name pmda \
  -p 5005:5005 \
  -v /path/to/config/config.json:/app/config.json:ro \
  -v /path/to/config/ai_prompt.txt:/app/ai_prompt.txt:ro \
  -v "/path/to/plex/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-in Support/Databases":/database:ro \
  -v /path/to/music:/music \
  -v /path/to/dupes:/dupes \
  silkyclouds/pmda:latest
```

It runs in verbose mode by default.

🧪 Run Without Docker (Bare Metal or Virtualenv)
------------------------------------------------

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/silkyclouds/PMDA.git
cd PMDA
```

2. Create a virtualenv and install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo apt install ffmpeg  # for ffprobe
```

3. Adjust `config.json` as shown above.

4. Run the Web UI:

```bash
python3 pmda.py --serve --verbose
```

5. Or run CLI mode:

```bash
python3 pmda.py --dry-run
```

🛠 CLI Options
--------------

- `--dry-run`: Simulate actions
- `--safe-mode`: Skip Plex API deletions
- `--tag-extra`: Keep non-standard album metadata
- `--verbose`: Show detailed logging
- `--serve`: Run Web UI

## 🛣️ Roadmap

Here are the next features planned for PMDA:

1. **Rollback System for Deduped Albums**  
   Add a second page listing all previously moved albums, with cover previews and metadata, allowing users to:
   - Restore individual albums
   - Selectively rollback multiple albums
   - Revert all deduplicated albums in one click

2. **"Re-download This Album" Flagging**  
   Detect albums with:
   - Missing tracks
   - MP3 or mixed FLAC/MP3 content  
   ...and mark them for replacement with clean, lossless versions.

3. **Local LLM Support (OpenLLaMA)**  
   Allow PMDA to run LLM-based logic locally using [OpenLLaMA](https://github.com/openlm-research/open_llama), for environments without internet or for cost-saving purposes.

4. **OpenAI Usage Tracking**  
   Display a badge in the main dashboard showing the current OpenAI API usage cost, if used.
