We have multiple rips of the *same* album. Please choose **one** edition as the "best" version, following the priority rules below (1 = most important). Carefully compare all versions before deciding. Be concise and fair.

Priority rules:

1. **Audio format**: Prefer lossless formats (e.g., FLAC, ALAC) over lossy ones (MP3, AAC).
2. **Bit depth**: Prefer higher bit depth (e.g., 24-bit > 16-bit).
3. **Track count**: Prefer editions with more tracks (more complete editions, bonus tracks included).
4. **File count**: Prefer editions with more audio files (multi-disc support, extras).
5. **Bitrate**: Prefer higher average bitrate.
6. **Track filenames**: Prefer editions where track filenames contain full song names rather than just generic numbering (e.g., "01.flac", "Track 02.mp3").
7. **Track title content**:
   - If a track title has something in parentheses that contains “feat.” or “ft.”, treat it as the same track — it's just a metadata difference.
   - If a track has parentheses with terms like "mix", "remix", "version", "edit", "rework", etc.:
     - Compare the remixer names.
     - If the remixer is different, **do NOT** consider it a duplicate. It is a distinct version.
     - If the remixer is the same, it can be considered a duplicate.
8. **Singles or EPs**:
   - If multiple editions have mostly different remixes or bonus tracks, treat them as **different releases** and **do not** mark them as duplicates.
   - Only consider as duplicates if the majority of track content is the same or only slightly different.

9. **MusicBrainz ID** (mbid):  
   - If editions share the **same** mbid → they are the *same* release.  
   - If mbids differ → consider them **different releases** unless all other factors (track list, bit-depth…) are identical.

10. **Release year**: newer re-masters / deluxe editions (higher year) are preferred *only* when they offer better technical quality or extra tracks.

Additional rule:

- If two editions **have no significant overlapping tracks**, treat them as **separate releases**, not duplicates — even if they share album titles or folder names.

Extra instructions:

- You must **analyze all editions**. If any **bonus or extra tracks** exist in editions **not selected as best**, but they **do not exist** in the selected edition, **report them** as extra tracks to merge.
- These tracks should be added to the selected edition if they are not duplicates.

Return your answer using this **strict format**:

<chosen_index>|Winner has:
- <bullet point explanation>
- <bullet point explanation>
|<comma-separated list of bonus/extra tracks>

Example:
1|Winner has:
- Best format (FLAC)
- 24-bit depth (vs 16-bit)
- 9 tracks vs 6 and 7 in other editions
- Unique tracks not present in other editions
|Track 08 - B-side exclusive, Track 09 - Remix by different artist

Do NOT include anything before or after this response. Keep it clean and structured. If no extra tracks are found, leave the third field empty but keep the trailing pipe.
