We have multiple rips of the *same* album. Choose exactly **one** edition as the "best". 
Before deciding, classify the release as classical or not.

Classification rule (write a tag in your rationale):
- If the work is by a classical composer or the metadata looks classical (composer/conductor/orchestra/opus numbers, “Symphony”, “Concerto”, “Sonata”, BWV/K./Op., etc.), add **[CLASSICAL:YES]** to your first bullet.
- Otherwise add **[CLASSICAL:NO]**.

If [CLASSICAL:YES], treat different interpretations as different releases:
- Two editions are the *same interpretation* only if:
  (a) they share a MusicBrainz ID (release, release-group, or album MBID), OR
  (b) they have the same release year (from tags date/originaldate) AND the same total runtime (to the second).
- If neither (a) nor (b) is true, they are NOT duplicates and you must still pick the technically best *within the same-interpretation cluster only*. If no same-interpretation cluster exists, pick the technically best but add a bullet **“different interpretation detected”**.

General priority rules (apply inside a valid cluster):
1. Audio format: prefer lossless (FLAC/ALAC) over lossy (MP3/AAC).
2. Bit depth: higher is better (24-bit > 16-bit).
3. Track count: more complete editions win (bonus tracks included).
4. File count: more audio files (multi-disc/extras) preferred.
5. Bitrate: higher average is better.
6. Track filenames: prefer meaningful names over generic numbering.
7. Parentheses in titles:
   - “feat./ft.” does NOT create a new track version.
   - “mix/remix/version/edit/rework”: if remixer differs → treat as different; same remixer → can be considered duplicate.
8. Singles/EPs: editions with same normalized title are duplicates; choose best by the rules above.
9. MusicBrainz ID:
   - Same MBID → same release.
   - Different MBIDs → different releases unless everything else (track list, bit-depth, duration) is identical.
10. Release year: a newer remaster is preferred only if it offers better technical quality or extra tracks.

Extra instructions:
- Analyse **all editions**. If any **bonus/extra tracks** exist only in non-selected editions, list them to merge.
- Ignore “fuzzy” inference for non-ASCII/CJK titles; rely on explicit metadata only.

Return your answer in this strict format:
<chosen_index>|Winner has:
- <bullet point explanation>   ← include [CLASSICAL:YES] or [CLASSICAL:NO] as the first bullet
- <bullet point explanation>
|<comma-separated list of bonus/extra tracks>

Example:
1|Winner has:
- [CLASSICAL:YES] same interpretation (shared MBID)
- Best format (FLAC), 24-bit vs 16-bit
- 9 tracks vs 7 in the other edition
|Track 09 - Bonus movement (alternate take)
